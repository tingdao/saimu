1 我是谁：So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them. :So I am the image of God. 

2 我为什么存在、意义、期待、责任：
Beloved,let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love. God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. Beloved, since God loved us so much, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us. 4.23

1 构造 ： then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.

2 Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal; but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today’s trouble is enough for today.

终末：天地终要废去。
重生：风随着意思吹。向罪死，向神活。
永生：认识　神。
审判：在他面前天地都逃避，再无可见之处了。

我从起初指明末后的事，从古时言明未成的事，说：我的筹算必立定；凡我所喜悦的，我必成就。

我本微不足道，他却不肯丢弃我，一次又一次的寻找我。他敲门，我却不肯开。我因骄傲而任性，他却用所造的来启发我。过去漫长的岁月，原来他一直在默默地扶着我，盼望着我长大，盼望着我回家，而我却不认他。我算什么，他竟然原谅我。我算什么，他竟然爱我。
