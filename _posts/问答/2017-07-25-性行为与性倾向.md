看到有朋友提到<天主教教理>, 其实梵蒂冈有专门制定相关情况的任职规定:
[Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with regard to  Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in view of their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders__](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccatheduc/documents/rc_con_ccatheduc_doc_20051104_istruzione_en.html)
这里面有一段也是引用<教理>的, 在此简要翻译一下(对天主教及同性恋术语不熟悉, 仅供参考):

...
> **2.Homosexuality and the Ordained Ministry**
**同性恋及神职任命**

> From the time of the Second Vatican Council until today, various Documents of the Magisterium, and especially the _Catechism of the Catholic Church_, have confirmed the teaching of the Church on homosexuality. The _Catechism_ distinguishes between homosexual acts and homosexual tendencies.
梵二以来, 关于同性恋问题, 一些训导文献与教会的教导是一致的, 尤其是<公教教理>. 该教理中, 对 同性性行为 与 同性性倾向 做了区分.

> Regarding _acts,_ it teaches that Sacred Scripture presents them as grave sins. The Tradition has constantly considered them as intrinsically immoral and contrary to the natural law. Consequently, under no circumstance can they be approved.
关于 同性性行为, 该教理认为圣经将其归为重罪. 传统一致认为这在本质上是不道德的, 是违背自然律的. 因此, 这是无论如何都不能接受的.

> Deep-seated homosexual _tendencies,_ which are found in a number of men and women, are also objectively disordered and, for those same people, often constitute a trial. Such persons must be accepted with respect and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. They are called to fulfil God's will in their lives and to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter.
深度的同性性倾向从客观上是混乱的, 无论男女, 此类人常处于试探之中. 这些人必须受到尊重与体贴, 应该避免对其任何不公的歧视. 他们蒙召实现上帝在他们身上的旨意, 在他们将面临的困难上与主十字架的献祭相联合.

> In the light of such teaching, this Dicastery, in accord with the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, believes it necessary to state clearly that the Church, while profoundly respecting the persons in question, cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practise homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called "gay culture".
照此, 根据会众敬拜及圣礼纪律, 本团认为有必要重申, 对于那些实践同性性行为者, 现有深度同性性倾向者, 或支持同性文化者, 教会虽由衷的尊重这些人, 但不允许其进入神学院或任圣职.

> Such persons, in fact, find themselves in a situation that gravely hinders them from relating correctly to men and women. One must in no way overlook the negative consequences that can derive from the ordination of persons with deep-seated homosexual tendencies.
这些人的处境严重阻碍他们与男女正确相处. 任命深度同性性倾向者会有不容忽视的后患.

> Different, however, would be the case in which one were dealing with homosexual tendencies that were only the expression of a transitory problem - for example, that of an adolescence not yet superseded. Nevertheless, such tendencies must be clearly overcome at least three years before ordination to the diaconate.
但暂时性同性性倾向者有所不同, 例如处于青春期阶段的. 不过, 他们必须完全克服并持续至少三年才可担任圣职.

----------------

应该说此议题上天主教的此观点类似于一些新教保守派的观点:
同性性行为是严重的罪.
同性性倾向本身不是罪, 但会导致很大的试探.
一些圣职对某些同性性倾向者是很大的挑战, 不适合担当.
