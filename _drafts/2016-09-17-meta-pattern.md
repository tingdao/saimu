the Kindom pattern: a pattern of the patterns

The following essay is tentative and exploratory, offered for your consideration. @在炑

If you are familiar with Mike Bull and the "Bible Matrix", you do know the patterns in the Bible. eg: Creation, Feasts, Covenant, Dominion, Tabernacle, Worship (of Covenant renewal), Sacrifice...

What are the relations among them? If God always works in fractals, should not these patterns have a pattern?

I discussed with Mike about this, and we got a solution:

    Creation
        Covenant
            Tabernacle
                Sacrifice
            Worship
        Dominion
    Feasts

It is a chiasm:
Creation-Feasts are about the days, Creation ends with sabbath, which is the beginning of the Feasts.
The Covenant will be opened in the Dominion.
The Tabernacle is the place for the Worship.

It matches the Dominion pattern, and matches the other 6 patterns, I suppose. But I'd like to take a step further. Let's think about Exodus-Levitics:

    1, Genesis: Moses leaded the Israel out of Egypt.
        2, Covenant: A literal covenant was made.
            3, Tabernacle: The literal tabernacle was built.
                4, Sacrifice: The literal offering system.
            5, Worship: Aaron and his sons
        6, Dominion: A clean and holy nation.
    7, Feasts: The literal feasts.

It seems that this sequence is distinctive. Maybe we can treat itself as a new pattern. Let's just call it the Kingdom pattern here for convenience.

But how could this be possible?

Think about the trinity. There are three "persons", and there is one "person". God inspired men to write the Bible, so it is seven. We have seven patterns, then we may have one pattern.

From another perspective: a pattern is a sort of theme about a subject(think about a wordpress site theme). There are structures/relations among the themes/subjects, so they may be composed into a new theme.

Let's imagine each subject is a sort of "color", then we have seven themes with seven colors. The Kingdom pattern/theme is the pattern about these colors. It is a palette/spectrum.

In fact, it is a scenario:

    After a genesis,
        a covenant was made,
            then a house was built.
                They are drawing near
            to worship,
        then they will go out to dominate
    and make a feast.

Then, do we have any other scripture matches this "Kingdom pattern"?

The Revelation seems to be another instance:

    1, the Alpha and the Omega
        2, the covenant letters
            3, the throne in heaven
                4, the Lamb, the seals, the 144000
            5, the trumpets, the scroll and the witnesses, the temple, the woman and the beasts, the songs, the three angles, the harvest
        6, the bowls, the Babylon
    7, the great supper of God

It also works with the Covenants:

    1, Adam, Genesis
        2, Noah, the first explicit "Covenant".
            3, Abraham, the house of God.
                4, Moses, Aaron, the Law and the offerings.
            5, David, Solomon, the singers.
        6, the Restoration, dominion of empire.
    7, Christ, the feasts.

Esther:

    1, The Genesis of Esther
        2, A marital covenant
            3, Mordecai at the king's gate
                4, The plan to kill all the Jews
            5, Fasting and prayer
        6, The queen with the king
    7, The feast of Purim

Samson:

    1, The Genesis of Samson
        2, The engagement
            3, Samson’s marriage
                4, The corn, the olives, the Philistines
            5, The hill of the jawbone and the spring
        6, Samson and his women
    7, The final feast

What do you think?
